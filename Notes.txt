Threads are becoming slower the longer and more they are used in the Mandelbrot app. I am not sure why this is yet. 

I think there is a memory issue, or something to do with an shared array, which is causing the threads to block the longer
they are in use. It might have to do with garbage collection. Resetting the threads seems to fix the issue.

Possible Routes to a Solutions: 
	1. Occasionally reset the threads - bad, doesn't address underlying issue. 
	2. Examine palette buffer shared array. This may have something to do with it. 
	3. Examine image buffer shared array. Possibly allocating and re-allocating new UInt8ClampedArray() is causing the issue. 
	4. Something to do with PutImageData?
